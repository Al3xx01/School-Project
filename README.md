# MindArkanoid

Game create by Casale Alex, Damiano Edoardo, Bagnis Davide, Esposito Christian, Carpinato Andrea of 4AROB (ITIS "M. Delpozzo" - Cuneo).

## What is MindGames?

We thought of a new way to play videogames: using your mind and your own body as a controller you can be in full control of the game and you can avoid every kind of issue with others physical controllers (such as joysticks).

This way to play videogames furthermore is fully accessible to people with physical or mental disabilities and it allows them to have fun with videogames.

### This Is MindGames

MindArkanoid is the practical implementation of the project MindGames.
We developed a version of the good old Arkanoid making sure that he can be controlled by player's mind.
