## What is MindGames?

We thought of a new way to play videogames: using your mind and your own body as a controller you can be in full control of the game and you can avoid every kind of issue with others physical controllers (such as joysticks).

This way to play videogames furthermore is fully accessible to people with physical or mental disabilities and it allows them to have fun with videogames.

## Hardware Components

To make our videogame interact with player's mind we used an EEG Helmet (Emotiv Epoc+ Â©), provided by IIT.
It's able to read people's brain activity and turn it into mental commands for the videogame.
In our case if the one who's playing loses his focus on the game, the paddle gets invisible so that it's more and more difficult to see it and as a consequence to play the videogame: the player is required to keep his focus on the game in this way.
The helmet also detects the movements of player's head and we have used this feature to move the paddle to right or to left so as to not let the ball fall.

This is very useful especially for people with disabilities who might not be able to move their hands or other parts of their body.
